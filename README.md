# My Project

One interesting piece of code in this project is how I parsed a date and time value from a single input line and split it 
into usable parts using LocalDateTime.

# LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.parse(parts[0] + "|" + parts[1], formatter);
# I read a date and time string from input like:
# "2025-04-24|17:54:11"
# I split it using parts[0] (date) and parts[1] (time), then recombined it with a pipe (|)
